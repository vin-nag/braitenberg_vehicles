# Simulating Braitenberg Vehicles Using Jupyter and Jyro #

## Introduction
This project simulates Braitenberg vehicles - introduced by Valentino Braitenberg as a thought experiment in his book, 
"Experiments in Synthetic Psychology". This is done as part of the graduate course, Artificial Life: Embodied Intelligence
at University of Waterloo. 
It uses Doug Blank's "jyro" module for robot simulations in Jupyter. Please note that the simulation as well as code were inspired from [here](https://github.com/Calysto/jyro/blob/master/docs/source/RobotFindLight.ipynb/) 
although it was modified by me to suit this application and for improved readability. 

## Usage
You are free to clone, run and modify this project as you see fit. 

### Source Code
The jupyter notebook is found as the `Worksheet.ipynb` file. The dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
